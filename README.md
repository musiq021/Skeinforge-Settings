# Richard's Skeinforge Settings*

## *that may or may not work for you

This is where I will try to push my settings when I verify that they work for me.

PLEASE always check all the settings before trying to use them. 

My current printer is a Mosaic by MakerGear, and until I change that, then these will likely be configured for it. 

As of the commit time of this README, the settings were used and tested on Skeinforge version 49. Newer versions probably will work; older will probably not (because new settings are added/changed in each version.

Enjoy!

(And if you find something terribly wrong, feel free to file an issue on github!)
